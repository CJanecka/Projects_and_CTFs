**Question 01** ***— What is the port of HTTPS?***

  + Answer: HTTPS occurs on **port 443** by default.
    - HTTPS stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure. It occurs on the *Application layer* of the [OSI model](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/open-systems-interconnection-model-osi/), as an extension of HTTP, and encrypts the data being transferred between a web server and a client *(web browser or application)*. Commonly used for online banking, secure logins, and e-commerce transactions.

**Question 02** ***— What is the port of SSH?***

  + Answer: SSH occurs on **port 22** by default.
    - SSH stands for Secure Shell. It occurs on the *Application layer* of the OSI model, and is a protocol that allows secure remote access and control of servers and systems. This is widely used for remote login and command execution over encrypted channels, making it a popular choice for server administrators.

**Question 03** ***— What is the port of SMTP?***

  + Answer: SMTP occurs on **port 25** by default.
    - SMTP stands for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol. It occurs on the *Application layer* of the OSI model; and is used to facilitate communication between the sending and receiving servers, when delivering an email message to a recipient.

**Question 04** ***— What is port 53 used for?***

  + Answer: Port 53 is the default used for Domain Name System (**DNS**) queries and responses.
    - DNS translates domain names (like, google.com) into IP addresses. It occurs on the *Application layer* of the OSI model, enabling web browsers and other applications to locate servers based on their domain names.

**Question 05** ***— What is port 123 used for?***

  + Answer: Port 123 is the default used for Network Time Protocol (**NTP**).
    -  This protocol works over the *Application layer* of the OSI model, and facilitates accurate timekeeping across different systems, by synchronizing the clocks of networked devices.

**Question 06** ***— What is the port of BGMP?***

  + The default port number for BGMP is **264**.
    - BGMP stands for Border Gateway Multicast Protocol. It operates on the *Transport layer* of the OSI model, and is a protocol used in networking to manage the distribution of multicast traffic across the internet.

**Question 07** ***— What is the port of Tomcat Remote Shutdown?***

  + Tomcat uses TCP port **8005** as a dedicated port for accepting shutdown requests.
    - This operates at the *Application layer* of the OSI model, and allows for administrative control over the Tomcat server, specifically for shutting down the server remotely.

**Question 08** ***— What is the port of Bitcoin?***

**Question 09** ***— What is the total amount of TCP and UDP ports?***

**Question 10** ***— Well known ports are from zero to what?***

**Question 11** ***— What TCP port does Call of Duty: Ghosts use on the Xbox 360?***
