## Overview

During this three-day penetration test, I strategically targeted a ficticious organization, utilizing both individual and collaborative efforts within a small team. The assessment focused on targeting the organization's web application, as well as its Linux and Windows hosts, systematically identifying vulnerabilities and potential security weaknesses. The complete pen-test report is provided as a PDF in this GitHub repository titled [Rekall Corporation - Penetration Test Report](https://github.com/CJanecka/Projects_and_CTFs/files/14016746/Rekall.Penetration.Test.Report._.Collin.Janecka.pdf). This detailed document provides a thorough analysis of the findings, including the identification of vulnerabilities, accompanied by a set of recommendations aimed at effectively mitigating the identified security concerns.
