## Overview

During this three-day penetration test, I strategically targeted a ficticious organization, utilizing both individual and collaborative efforts within a small team. The assessment focused on targeting the organization's web application, as well as its Linux and Windows hosts, systematically identifying vulnerabilities and potential security weaknesses. The complete pen-test report is provided as a PDF in this GitHub repository titled [Rekall Corporation - Penetration Test Report](https://github.com/CJanecka/Projects_and_CTFs/files/14016819/Rekall.Corporation.-.Penetration.Test.Report._.Collin.Janecka.pdf). This detailed document provides a thorough analysis of the findings, including the identification of vulnerabilities, accompanied by a set of recommendations aimed at effectively mitigating the identified security concerns.

## Executive Summary

As a representative of Ultimate Pentesting, LLC, I spearheaded a comprehensive three-day penetration test targeting Total Rekall's network. The assessment achieved all outlined objectives within the defined scope, evaluating the web application, Linux, and Windows systems to uncover critical vulnerabilities and potential risks. I concluded this project by drafting the pen-test report, attached above, which includes a detailed breakdown for each system, their vulnerabilities, and recommended remediations. These recommendations cover a range of implementation costs and complexity, offering a tailored approach to enhance Total Rekall's security measures.
