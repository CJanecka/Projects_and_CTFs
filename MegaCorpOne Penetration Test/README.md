## Overview

On behalf of IronCurtain Testing, LLC, I undertook a solo penetration test with a focus on scrutinizing the web application, Linux hosts, and Windows hosts of the fictional entity, *MegaCorpOne*. This assessment brought to light notable security vulnerabilities within these systems. Here, I present an outline of my findings, emphasizing key vulnerabilities identified during the evaluation. The complete pen-test report is provided as a PDF, in this GitHub repository, titled [MegaCorpOne - Penetration Test Report](https://github.com/CJanecka/Projects_and_CTFs/files/14173862/MegaCorpOne.-.Penetration.Test.Report_Collin.Janecka.pdf). This document encapsulates my assessment findings, including all of the identified vulnerabilities and suggested ways to address each concern.

## Project Requirements

The project requirements included:

  + Providing an analysis of security flaws present in MegaCorpOne’s web applications, networks, and systems.

  + Utilizing the MITRE framework to discover vulnerabilities in the organization’s Linux and Windows hosts.

  + Documenting my findings and recommended mitigations in a penetration testing summary report.
