# Projects and CTFs

Here are some of the projects and capture-the-flag challenges I've completed, both during a Cybersecurity Bootcamp and on my own. I found these experiences particularly enjoyable. My goal is to share the knowledge I've gained and encourage collaboration. Please let me know if you notice any errors or feel free to reach out if you're interested in connecting.
