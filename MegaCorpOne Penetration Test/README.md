## Overview

On behalf of IronCurtain Testing, LLC, I undertook a solo penetration test with a focus on scrutinizing the web application, Linux hosts, and Windows hosts of the fictional entity, *MegaCorpOne*. This assessment brought to light notable security vulnerabilities within these systems. Here, I present an outline of my findings, emphasizing key vulnerabilities identified during the evaluation. The complete pen-test report is provided as a PDF, in this GitHub repository, titled [MegaCorpOne - Penetration Test Report](https://github.com/CJanecka/Projects_and_CTFs/files/14173862/MegaCorpOne.-.Penetration.Test.Report_Collin.Janecka.pdf). This document encapsulates my assessment findings, including all of the identified vulnerabilities and suggested ways to address each concern.

## Project Requirements

The project requirements included:

  + Providing an analysis of security flaws present in MegaCorpOne’s web applications, networks, and systems.

  + Utilizing the MITRE framework to discover vulnerabilities in the organization’s Linux and Windows hosts.

  + Documenting my findings and recommended mitigations in a penetration testing summary report.

## Equipment and Tools

***Technologies Used:*** Penetration testing methodology, OSINT (Google dorking, Shodan, certificate transparency), MITRE matrix, Nmap (with NSE scripts), Metasploit, Privilege Escalation, John the Ripper, Lateral Movement, Mimikatz, msfvenom, Meterpreter, Windows and Linux OS, DC replication, DCSync attack, Persistence, Reporting.

  + Conducted a penetration test on a simulated organization using the Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES) methodology and the MITRE Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge (ATT&CK) framework.

  + Found and successfully exploited vulnerabilities in the organization's web application, Linux, and Windows hosts.

  + Summarized the results and suggested ways to address the identified issues in a detailed penetration testing report.
