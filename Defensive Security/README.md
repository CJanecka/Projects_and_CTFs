## Overview

In this project I played the role of a Security Operations Center *(SOC)* analyst for a small company, called Virtual Space Industries *(VSI)*. Tasked with monitoring an Apache web server, that hosts the administrative webpage; and a Windows operating system, which runs many of VSIâ€™s back-end operations. I employed Splunk to craft a monitoring environment, developing tailored reports, alerts, dashboards, and an add-on app to fortify the security of this fictitional  organization. A pivotal element of this project entailed simulating an attack to gauge the efficacy of my monitoring solutions. Subsequent to the simulated attack, I conducted an analysis to evaluate the system's performance in detecting and mitigating the threat. The culmination of this effort was presented to my cybersecurity bootcamp class, to offer insights for enhancing cybersecurity within a broader organizational context. <add docs here>
