## Overview

*This page is incomplete, I am updating this while studying for the Sec+ certification exam. Some of the information included may only serve as a placeholder, or template, for later revision. I appreciate your patience while I complete this page.*

I based my design largely on a tutorial from [freeCodeCamp on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xV7S8BhIeBo). While working through the tutorial, I faced some coding issues that affected the functionality of certain elements on the webpage. To address these issues, and tailor the page design to my preferences, I made additional modifications to improve both aesthetics and functionality. 

This repository displays a redacted version of the portfolio I created. I am currently reviewing and refining the code. Upon completion, my intention is to upload the full code to GitHub, allowing anyone interested to effortlessly replicate the page.
