## Overview

During this three-day, Capture-the-Flag style, penetration test, I acted as a representative for *Ultimate Pentesting, LLC*, hired by a ficticious organization *Rekall Corportion* to test their network. Both individual and collaborative efforts within a small team were utilized. The assessment focused on targeting the organization's web application, as well as its Linux and Windows hosts, systematically identifying vulnerabilities and potential security weaknesses. The complete pen-test report is provided as a PDF in this GitHub repository titled [Rekall Corporation - Penetration Test Report](https://github.com/CJanecka/Projects_and_CTFs/files/14016819/Rekall.Corporation.-.Penetration.Test.Report._.Collin.Janecka.pdf). This detailed document provides a thorough analysis of my findings, including the identification of vulnerabilities, accompanied by a set of recommendations aimed at effectively mitigating the identified security concerns.

## Project Requirements

The project requirements included:

  + Examination of the organization's web application, leading to the discovery of vulnerabilities embedded in their website. Leveraging Burp Suite, identified and documented these vulnerabilities, aiming to fortify the organization's online security.

  + Employing the MITRE framework to systematically scrutinize the security of the organization's Linux and Windows hosts. Allowing vulnerabilities and potential threat vectors within the infrastructure to be uncovered.

  + Compiled findings and recommended mitigations into a comprehensive penetration testing report. This serves as a valuable resource for the organization, providing a clear roadmap for addressing vulnerabilities and enhancing their overall security posture.

## Equipment and Tools

***Technologies Used:*** Penetration testing methodology, MITRE framework, OSINT tools, Metasploit/Meterpreter, vulnerability scanning with Nmap and Nessus, Burp Suite.

  + Performed a penetration test on a simulated organization in accordance with the Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES) methodology and the MITRE Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge (ATT&CK) framework.
    
  + Identified and successfully exploited vulnerabilities within the organization's web application, as well as on Linux and Windows hosts.

  + Documented the findings and proposed mitigation strategies within a comprehensive penetration testing summary report.
